YouTube Sound Board

This project allows a user to create a soundboard from YouTube URLs. They can select a sound, create a button to play it, and optionally choose a start/end time, as well as loop the sound.
The user can create section headings and drag buttons around to different sections. The soundboard settings are stored locally in the browser, but the user can export and import this arrangement into a JSON file.
Clicking the button starts the sound, clicking again stops it.
